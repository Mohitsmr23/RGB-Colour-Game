representing values 213 for red ,83 for green ,156 for blue respectively on top of the game interface.Everytime you load the page for game or when you select play again button in the game you are going to get different RGB values and your job is to guess the correct colour which matches the given RGB value in the game.If you guess it correctly correct! message will be displayed along with making every square of colours same to the colour of correctly guessed one and if you failed to guess it correctly it will show you Try again! message and will keep removing the colour square which has been clicked and doesn't matches the required RGB value untill you guess it correctly.
